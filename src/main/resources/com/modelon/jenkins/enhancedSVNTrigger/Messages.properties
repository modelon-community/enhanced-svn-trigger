PollerJob.description=Triggers new builds for monitored jobs when changes are \
made to SVN URLs used by the job. New builds are triggered for each \
change that is made to the SVN URLs used by the job. This behavior differs \
from the Jenkins default when it comes to polling, where multiple commits may \
be served by the same build.
