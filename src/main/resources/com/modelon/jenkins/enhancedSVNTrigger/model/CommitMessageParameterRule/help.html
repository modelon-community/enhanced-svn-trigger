<p>
    Definitions of commit message parameter extraction rules. Each rule
    defines a <b>pattern</b>, <b>replacement</b> and <b>destination parameter</b>.
    If matches are found, then they are exposed as parameters and environment
    variables to the build.
</p>
<p>
    If a build is triggered due to a commit in the repository, as opposed to
    new repository location, then the pattern of each rule is applied to the
    commit message of the triggering commit. If a match is found, then a
    parameter with the given name and replacement value will be available to
    the build.
</p>
<p>
    The following magical <b>destination parameter</b>s are available and will
    be treated specially when matched in the commit message:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>TRIGGER_CAUSE</b>, replaces the default trigger cause generated
        by this plugin</li>
    <li><b>UPSTREAM_BUILD_URL</b>, if the resulting parameter resolves to an
        URL which references an existing Jenkins build in this Jenkins
        instance, then the triggered build will be marked as an downstream
        build of the resolved build</li>
</ul>
